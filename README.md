## 4. Explanation
### Concurrency:
    Used goroutines and wiat group to fetch weather data for each day in parallel.
    Each dayâ€™s forecast is fetched concurrently for both APIs (Open-Meteo and WeatherAPI).
    The results are sent through a channel and collected in the main function.
    
### Data Aggregation:
    The aggregated data is collected from both APIs and returned in a single JSON response, organized by API and day.
    
### Error Handling:
    Basic error handling is implemented for API calls, and if any error occurs, a message is logged, and the result for that particular API call is skipped.
    
### API Integration:
    Open-Meteo does not require an API key, and the request is straightforward.
    WeatherAPI requires an API key, which is passed as a query parameter.
    
### HTTP Endpoint:
    The server exposes the /weather endpoint, which accepts latitude (lat), longitude (lon), and apiKey as query parameters.
